I did not know how to program in any way, shape, or form prior to this project. I learned basic JavaScript as I was creating this bot, and even now I still have much to learn about JavaScript. This was and is a fun project for me!

The bot has evolved significantly over time.

## Features:

- "Dialect" response
- Text-based prefix commands
- Wide array of application (/) commands
- A local database
- Economy and inventory system
- Basic event logging
- Verification and reaction roles system
- Ability to DM users
- Ability to recieve DMs
- Welcome messaging

- Event and command handlers
- Error handling
