## _A Discord Bot_

A multi-function Discord bot created with Discord.js V13, intended for use in a lone server. Features include unique phrase response ("dialects"), text and slash commands, an economy/inventory system, reaction roles, music features, and more.

Created by mezmer420#7301

I did not know how to program in any way, shape, or form prior to this project. I learned basic JavaScript as I was creating this bot, and even now I still have much to learn about JavaScript. This was and is a fun project for me!

The bot has evolved significantly over time.

The bot itself won't be made public as there's way too much stuff specifically designed only for our server. But feel free to browse the code for inspiration for your own bot(s).

## Features:

- "Dialect" response
- Text-based prefix commands
- Wide array of application (/) commands
- A local database
- Economy and inventory system
- Chat bot

- Event and command handlers
- Intensive Error handling +
- a dedicated Anti-crash system to make a crash close to impossible
